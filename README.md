# Tech

The Waitlisters website harnasses a variety of technologies:

* [HTML5 Up | Stellar](https://html5up.net/stellar) - Responsive HTML5 template as skeleton for site (heavily modified, mainly via CSS) 
* [ThumbnailGridExpandingPreview](https://github.com/codrops/ThumbnailGridExpandingPreview) - a thumbnail grid with an expanding image preview similar to the effect seen on Google Images
* [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) - takes a Google Spreadsheet and makes it easily accessible through JavaScript
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) - the worldâ€™s most popular and easiest to use icon set 
* [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) - tools to analyze site visitors
* [jQuery] - JS library

### Development

The website is maintained by [Santiago Moreno](https://github.com/rolsanmordua) (web lead for the Waitlisters) and [Alex Bellon](https://github.com/alex-bellon) (Cyber Security, Social Media, and Marketing lead). [Chia-Hua Lu](https://github.com/ChiaHuaLu) (secondary web lead) ocassionally contributes to the site as well. 

Santiago began the first version of the site at HackTX 2017 in October of 2017. The site started as a page to host information about the Waitlisters first hackathon project and later expanded to include team member information. 

Today the site is in its second iteration and has significantly expanded beyond the scope of the original website.
